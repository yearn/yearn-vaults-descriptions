	"yearn-and-curve-synergy-description": "One of the critical components of Yearn’s infrastructure includes a collaborative relationship with [Curve.fi](https://curve.fi/). Several Yearn vaults provide liquidity into Curve pools and stake the liquidity provider (LP) tokens into the respective gauges, earning CRV rewards.\n\nYearn locks **10%** of all CRV rewards earned into the yveCRV-DAO (“Backscratcher”) to obtain an additional amount of CRV.",
	"yearn-and-curve-synergy-description-next": "\n\nFor a deeper understanding, refer to the [Understanding Curve Boost Multipliers](/curve-boost-multipliers) section.\n\nFurthermore, the remaining 90% of the CRV earned are swapped into the respective LP tokens, and re-deposited into the vault. The only exception is the yvUSDN3Crv vault that locks 50% of the CRV earned into the Backscratcher vault and swaps the remaining 50%.",

	"yearn-and-curve-yveCRV-description": "This vault converts your CRV into yveCRV, earning you a continuous share of Curve fees which are boosted over what you earn staking at Curve. The more CRV converted, the greater your weekly rewards. Every Friday, these can be claimed from the vault as 3Crv (Curve’s 3pool LP token).\n\nYearn, itself, deposits 10% of all CRV earned into this vault and gives its 3crv rewards to vault token holders which is where the boosted weekly rewards come from.\n\nDepositing is non-reversible: You can only convert CRV into yveCRV, as the CRV is perpetually staked in Curve’s voting escrow. All vaults send 10% of earned CRV to this vault to sustain boost levels.\n\nFor more detailed information see this medium article: [https://medium.com/iearn/thats-boost-folks-7afae75db826](https://medium.com/iearn/thats-boost-folks-7afae75db826)",

	"curve-boost-description": "Using the crvCOMP pool, as an example, liquidity providers earn approximately 12.82% APY in trading fees, and an additional 24.72% APY (as of the date of this publication) in the form of CRV rewards, if they stake their liquidity provider tokens in the Curve gauge.\n\nDepositors can boost the CRV rewards earned by locking CRV into the voting escrow module, with a max boost of **2.5x**. This size of the boost is dependent on the amount of CRV locked in the voter escrow, and the size of the deposit in the liquidity pool, however, this [calculator](https://dao.curve.fi/minter/calc) is useful in modeling potential boost multipliers. The max boost for the crvCOMP pool yields an additional 61.81% APY in the form of CRV rewards, which is displayed below.",
	"curve-boost-description-next": "Yearn stakes the Curve liquidity provider token into the gauge to earn CRV rewards. 10% of these rewards are locked in our yveCRV-DAO vault (described above) to boost the rewards of all yVaults with Curve strategies.\n\nFor more information on Curve boost multipliers please see Curve’s documentation for this topic — [here](https://resources.curve.fi/guides/boosting-your-crv-rewards).",
